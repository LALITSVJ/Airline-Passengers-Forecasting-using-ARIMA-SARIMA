# Airline-Passengers-Forecasting-using-ARIMA-SARIMA

### Project Title: Airline Passengers Forecasting

Problem Statement: Read and analyse the number of passengers travelling via a particular airline over the given period of time and implement statistical models like ARIMA and SARIMA to forecast the passengers count. Also, compare the both models's performance.

### Code Files Description:
1. Data_Preprocessing.ipynb:
Given Data is imported, read, undertood, analysed and prepared for model implementation.
Learnings: Data Normalisation, how to nullify trend, volatility and seasonal component.

2. Dickey–Fuller-Test.ipynb:
Explained Dickey–Fuller test implementation for both seasonal and non-seasonal data.

3. ARIMA_SARIMA_Implementation.ipynb: 
Implemented ARIMA and SARIMA models. Also, implemented ACF-PACF plots and how to decide AR and MA component for both models.

### Dataset Description:
File Name: airline-passengers.csv
It contains two columns; 
    column 1: Month (date) 
    column 2: Passengers (number of passengers travelled using particular airline during Jan. 1949 till Dec. 1960)
